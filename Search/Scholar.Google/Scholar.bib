This complexity of AI products hinders seamless execution and interdisciplinary collaboration crucial for human-centered AI products. Relevant to industry and innovation, it affects strategic decision-making and investment risk mitigation. Current approaches provide limited insights into the potential and feasibility of AI product ideas. Employing Design Science Research, the study identifies challenges and integrates no-code AutoML as a solution by presenting a framework for AI product prototyping with No-code AutoML. A case study confirms its potential in supporting non-experts, offering a structured approach to AI product development. The framework facilitates accessible and interpretable prototyping, benefiting academia, managers, and decision-makers. Strategic integration of no-code AutoML enhances efficiency, empowers non-experts, and informs early-stage decisions, albeit with acknowledged limitations.},

	abstract = {Background
              Metamodels can address some of the limitations of complex simulation models by formulating a mathematical relationship between input parameters and simulation model outcomes. Our objective was to develop and compare the performance of a machine learning (ML)–based metamodel against a conventional metamodeling approach in replicating the findings of a complex simulation model.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We constructed 3 ML-based metamodels using random forest, support vector regression, and artificial neural networks and a linear regression-based metamodel from a previously validated microsimulation model of the natural history hepatitis C virus (HCV) consisting of 40 input parameters. Outcomes of interest included societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of HCV treatment versus no treatment, cost-effectiveness analysis curve (CEAC), and expected value of perfect information (EVPI). We evaluated metamodel performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson’s R
                2
                on the normalized data.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                The R
                2
                values for the linear regression metamodel for QALYs without treatment, QALYs with treatment, societal cost without treatment, societal cost with treatment, and ICER were 0.92, 0.98, 0.85, 0.92, and 0.60, respectively. The corresponding R
                2
                values for our ML-based metamodels were 0.96, 0.97, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.49 for support vector regression; 0.99, 0.83, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.82 for artificial neural network; and 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 for random forest. Similar trends were observed for RMSE. The CEAC and EVPI curves produced by the random forest metamodel matched the results of the simulation output more closely than the linear regression metamodel.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              ML-based metamodels generally outperformed traditional linear regression metamodels at replicating results from complex simulation models, with random forest metamodels performing best.
            
            
              Highlights
              Decision-analytic models are frequently used by policy makers and other stakeholders to assess the impact of new medical technologies and interventions. However, complex models can impose limitations on conducting probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value-of-information analysis, and may not be suitable for developing online decision-support tools. Metamodels, which accurately formulate a mathematical relationship between input parameters and model outcomes, can replicate complex simulation models and address the above limitation. The machine learning–based random forest model can outperform linear regression in replicating the findings of a complex simulation model. Such a metamodel can be used for conducting cost-effectiveness and value-of-information analyses or developing online decision support tools.},

	abstract = {As big data grows ubiquitous across many domains, more and more stakeholders seek to develop Machine Learning (ML) applications on their data. The success of an ML application usually depends on the close collaboration of ML experts and domain experts. However, the shortage of ML engineers remains a fundamental problem. Low-code Machine learning tools/platforms (aka, AutoML) aim to democratize ML development to domain experts by automating many repetitive tasks in the ML pipeline. This research presents an empirical study of around 14k posts (questions + accepted answers) from Stack Overflow (SO) that contained AutoML-related discussions. We examine how these topics are spread across the various Machine Learning Life Cycle (MLLC) phases and their popularity and difficulty. This study offers several interesting findings. First, we find 13 AutoML topics that we group into four categories. The MLOps topic category (43\% questions) is the largest, followed by Model (28\% questions), Data (27\% questions), Documentation (2\% questions). Second, Most questions are asked during Model training (29\%) (i.e., implementation phase) and Data preparation (25\%) MLLC phase. Third, AutoML practitioners find the MLOps topic category most challenging, especially topics related to model deployment \& monitoring and Automated ML pipeline. These findings have implications for all three AutoML stakeholders: AutoML researchers, AutoML service vendors, and AutoML developers. Academia and Industry collaboration can improve different aspects of AutoML, such as better DevOps/deployment support and tutorial-based documentation.},

	abstract = {Data-driven engineering refers to systematic data collection and processing using machine learning to improve engineering systems. Currently, the implementation of data-driven engineering relies on fundamental data science and software engineering skills. At the same time, model-based engineering is gaining relevance for the engineering of complex systems. In previous work, a model-based engineering approach integrating the formalization of machine learning tasks using the general-purpose modeling language SysML is presented. However, formalized machine learning tasks still require the implementation in a specialized programming languages like Python. Therefore, this work aims to facilitate the implementation of data-driven engineering in practice by extending the previous work of formalizing machine learning tasks by integrating model transformation to generate executable code. The method focuses on the modifiability and maintainability of the model transformation so that extensions and changes to the code generation can be integrated without requiring modifications to the code generator. The presented method is evaluated for feasibility in a case study to predict weather forecasts. Based thereon, quality attributes of model transformations are assessed and discussed. Results demonstrate the flexibility and the simplicity of the method reducing efforts for implementation. Further, the work builds a theoretical basis for standardizing data-driven engineering implementation in practice.},
