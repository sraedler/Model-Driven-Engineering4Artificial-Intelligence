abstract = {Many games have computer-controlled agents that play against a player. The behavior of these computer-controlled agents is described by means of the artificial intelligence (AI) in the game. The AI is an important component of the game, and needs to be developed carefully, and adapted regularly. This paper introduces a novel language for describing the decision making process of the AI in real-time video games. We develop a declarative, domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in the functional programming language Haskell for real-time video games. We use the DSL to describe the AI of a prototype real-time video game.},

abstract = {In the field of AI and Law, there is a debate whether normative relations can be expressed using only deontic concepts versus the opinion that a potestative perspective on norms cannot be reduced to deontic expressions. Makinson, Jones and Sergot are proponents of the latter view. In this paper, we will expand on their examples of priests marrying couples of mixed religions, and couples married by former priests, in order to better understand the notion of power.In this quest, we believe it is important to investigate the sources of norms, in this case the Code of Canon Law on Catholic marriage. We will do so using our method Calculemus and illustrate this method for making interpretation models of normative systems using a domain specific language (FLINT) for expressing frames for institutional acts, duties and facts. In this paper, we will give an overview of our analysis. An extended version of this paper will be published on Research Gate.},

abstract = {In the cybersecurity domain, the level of standardization and interoperability among cybersecurity products from different vendors, including open-source ones, is fairly low. Although understandable from a business perspective, this deficiency makes it difficult and expensive for analysts to put together custom solutions and to have visibility across their entire IT infrastructure. It also hampers the adoption of custom data analytics and AI solutions, and slows down the exchange of threat detection and mitigation solutions.Recently, the Nugget domain specific language (DSL) has been proposed as a solution to the integration of digital forensics computations. The essential idea is to use a data flow language, somewhat similar to SQL, and an extensible run-time environment to decouple the specification of forensic computations from their implementation.In this paper, we study the integration of Nugget with security monitoring tools; specifically, we integrate Google's GRR incident response framework, and the de facto standard for log aggregation: Splunk. We demonstrate the utility of this type standardization to both tool developers and end-user analysts/IT administrators. We discuss potential implications of having such a DSL becoming widely adopted across the entire domain of cybersecurity.},
