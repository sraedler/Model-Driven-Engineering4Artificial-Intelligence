abstract = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two separate fields in computer science, which can clearly benefit from cross-fertilization and collaboration. There are at least two ways in which such integrations---which we call MDE Intelligence---can manifest: (1) MDE can benefit from integrating AI concepts and ideas to increasing the power and flexibility of model-driven techniques by means of the application of AI algorithms. (2) Conversely, AI can benefit from integrating concepts and ideas from MDE---for example, using domain-specific languages and model transformations allows domain experts to directly express and manipulate their problems while providing an auditable computation pipeline.To discuss and further stimulate such integrations, the 1st edition of the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Model-driven Engineering (MDE Intelligence) was held on September 16, 2019 in Munich, Germany, as part of the satellite events of the IEEE/ACM 22th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2019).},

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in research on the combination of AI techniques and methods with MDE. However, there is a gap between AI and MDE practices, as well as between researchers and practitioners. This paper tackles this gap by reporting on industrial requirements in this field. In the AIDOaRt research project, practitioners and researchers collaborate on AI-augmented automation supporting modeling, coding, testing, monitoring, and continuous development in cyber-physical systems. The project specifically lies at the intersection of industry and academia collaboration with several industrial use cases. Through a process of elicitation and refinement, 78 high-level requirements were defined, and generalized into 30 generic requirements by the AIDOaRt partners. The main contribution of this paper is the set of generic requirements from the project for enhancing the development of cyber-physical systems with artificial intelligence, DevOps, and model-driven engineering, identifying the hot spots of industry needs in the interactions of MDE and AI. Future work will refine, implement and evaluate solutions toward these requirements in industry contexts.},

abstract = {There are many application domains, such as distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems, where the domain constraints are so restrictive and the solution spaces so large that it is infeasible for modelers to produce correct solution manually using a conventional graphical model-based approach. In DRE systems the available resources, such as memory, CPU, and bandwidth, must be managed carefully to ensure a certain level of quality of service. This paper provides three contributions to simplify modeling of complex application domains: (1) we present our approach of combining model intelligence and domain-specific solvers with model-driven engineering (MDE) environments, (2) we show techniques for automatically guiding modelers to correct solutions and how to support the specification of large and complex systems using intelligent mechanisms to complete partially specified models, and (3) we present the results of applying an MDE tool that maps software components to Electronic Control Units (ECUs) using the typical automotive modeling and middleware infrastructure.},

abstract = {Coming from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Semantic Web (SW) circles, ontologies are used mainly to represent domains. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) field gave birth to Domain Specific Languages to represent a particular technical domain. Abstracting from their uses, we consider as many others researchers that ontologies and models are closer than their original fields could get to think. Furthermore, their building or development are facing the same problems. They are costly and need experts' interviews in order to grasp specific knowledge and structure it. Likewise, ontologies and DSL can benefit from each other domains in reusing construction methodologies and even reusing knowledge modelled in another format. In this paper we first present the ontologies and DSL definition we use and some methodologies of development enabling the reuse of knowledge (as alignment, fusion). We then present how we propose to reuse the knowledge of a robotic ontology to develop robotic DSLs within the PROTEUS project in order to inject readymade domain information to the DSL.},
