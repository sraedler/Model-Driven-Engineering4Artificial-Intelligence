abstract = {Ever increasing complexity of modern software systems demands new powerful development mechanisms. Model-driven engineering (MDE) can ease the development process through problem abstraction and automated code generation from models. In order for MDE solutions to be trusted, such generation should preserve the system's properties defined at modelling level, both functional and extra-functional, all the way down to the target code. The outcome of our research is an approach that aids the preservation of system's properties in MDE of embedded systems. More specifically, we provide generation of full source code from design models defined using the CHESS-ML, monitoring of selected extra-functional properties at code level, and back-propagation of observed values to design models. The approach is validated against industrial case-studies in the telecommunications applicative domain.},

abstract = {The recently wide adoption of data science approaches to decision making in several application domains (such as health, business and even education) open new challenges in engineering and implementation of this systems. Considering the big picture of data science, Machine learning is the wider used technique and due to its characteristics, we believe that a better engineering methodology and tools are needed to realize innovative data-driven systems able to satisfy the emerging quality attributes (such as, debias and fariness, explainability, privacy and ethics, sustainability). This research project will explore the following three pillars: i) identify key quality attributes, formalize them in the context of data science pipelines and study their relationships; ii) define a new software engineering approach for data-science systems development that assures compliance with quality requirements; iii) implement tools that guide IT professionals and researchers in the realization of ML-based data science pipelines since the requirement engineering. Moreover, in this paper we also presents some details of the project showing how the feature models and model-driven engineering can be leveraged to realize our project.},
