abstract = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two separate fields in computer science, which can clearly benefit from cross-fertilization and collaboration. There are at least two ways in which such integrations---which we call MDE Intelligence---can manifest: (1) MDE can benefit from integrating AI concepts and ideas to increasing the power and flexibility of model-driven techniques by means of the application of AI algorithms. (2) Conversely, AI can benefit from integrating concepts and ideas from MDE---for example, using domain-specific languages and model transformations allows domain experts to directly express and manipulate their problems while providing an auditable computation pipeline.To discuss and further stimulate such integrations, the 1st edition of the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Model-driven Engineering (MDE Intelligence) was held on September 16, 2019 in Munich, Germany, as part of the satellite events of the IEEE/ACM 22th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2019).},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently on top of the hype regarding simultaneously research publications and industrial development. However, the current status of AI makes it quite far and different from the current understanding of Human intelligence. One suggestion that is made in this article is that Model-Driven approaches could be considered as an interesting avenue to complement classical visions of AI and to provide some missing features. Specifically, the use of Model-Driven Engineering tools (such as metamodel and model transformation) could benefit to the domain of AI by introducing a way to extend the apprehension of unknown situations. To support that proposal, an illustrative example is provided regarding the domain of risk and crisis management.},

abstract = {Urbanization, exceptional increase in population and advancement in technology caused the automotive industry to grow rapidly &amp; automobiles become essential part of daily life. Consequently, finding a parking space particularly in populous zones, is a challenging task. Researchers have proposed different solutions to assist the developments in smart parking systems. In this paper, we have investigated the key tools, techniques &amp; challenges proposed in the recent research studies. Primarily, a Systematic Literature Review is carried out, total 35 studies are explored during time interval of (2015-2019). Subsequently, five major areas are recognized where smart parking is often functional i.e. Internet of Things (IoT) (13 studies), Cloud Computing (2 studies), Model-Driven Engineering (4 studies), Fog Computing (6 studies) and Artificial Intelligence (11 studies). Furthermore, (15) primary tools and (25) algorithms are presented. This article also portray the challenges cited by different studies. The findings of this study will definitely assist the practitioners while deciding the appropriate selections.},

abstract = {Coming from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Semantic Web (SW) circles, ontologies are used mainly to represent domains. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) field gave birth to Domain Specific Languages to represent a particular technical domain. Abstracting from their uses, we consider as many others researchers that ontologies and models are closer than their original fields could get to think. Furthermore, their building or development are facing the same problems. They are costly and need experts' interviews in order to grasp specific knowledge and structure it. Likewise, ontologies and DSL can benefit from each other domains in reusing construction methodologies and even reusing knowledge modelled in another format. In this paper we first present the ontologies and DSL definition we use and some methodologies of development enabling the reuse of knowledge (as alignment, fusion). We then present how we propose to reuse the knowledge of a robotic ontology to develop robotic DSLs within the PROTEUS project in order to inject readymade domain information to the DSL.},

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in research on the combination of AI techniques and methods with MDE. However, there is a gap between AI and MDE practices, as well as between researchers and practitioners. This paper tackles this gap by reporting on industrial requirements in this field. In the AIDOaRt research project, practitioners and researchers collaborate on AI-augmented automation supporting modeling, coding, testing, monitoring, and continuous development in cyber-physical systems. The project specifically lies at the intersection of industry and academia collaboration with several industrial use cases. Through a process of elicitation and refinement, 78 high-level requirements were defined, and generalized into 30 generic requirements by the AIDOaRt partners. The main contribution of this paper is the set of generic requirements from the project for enhancing the development of cyber-physical systems with artificial intelligence, DevOps, and model-driven engineering, identifying the hot spots of industry needs in the interactions of MDE and AI. Future work will refine, implement and evaluate solutions toward these requirements in industry contexts.},

abstract = {Service-oriented computing is the "new wave" emerging from the growing up of web services and its adoption of elements of semantic web technology. More sophistication, in response to business requirements, does of course not make it easier to use or to control. In particular business processes demand resilience and (real-time) adaptation in the face of changing business requirements, incorporation of alternative services and finding suitable substitutes when those needed are not available. The EU-funded ALIVE project is prototyping ideas, driven by commercial and industrial uses cases, that utilize research in organizational modelling, software agents, model-driven engineering, artificial intelligence, semantic web and web services to construct tools and demonstrators to address these needs. This tutorial will focus on a use case from the ALIVE project (in one of the domains of crisis management, communications, or information services), discuss the requirements that arise from it and then explore it from the three perspectives that characterize the ALIVE approach: organizations, coordination and services, all illustrated by the innovative tools that have been developed during the project.More information about the ALIVE project can be downloaded from http://www.ist-alive.eu and a public release of the ALIVE tools, integrated into the Eclipse IDE will be available from mid October via the above website.},

abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.},

abstract = {Mobility and integration of systems into the physical environment are key challenges for computer science. In particular, User Interfaces (UI) must accommodate variations in the context of use while preserving human-centered properties. We call this capacity UI plasticity. This tutorial begins by reviewing ideas from the last decade concerning the plasticity of user interfaces. From this starting point, it develops key ideas and perspectives for the near future. These are illustrated with a demo of a tool for prototyping plastic widgets and UIs.In the near future, there will be a need for elaborating a theory of adaptation to predict and explain the difficulties that users encounter when adaptation occurs. Secondly, in order to go beyond simplistic UI adaptation, there will be a need to bring together advances in several research areas including HCI (to support multimodality), Software Engineering (in particular, Model-Driven Engineering, Aspect Oriented Programming, as well as components and services, to cover both design time and run time adaptation), as well as Artificial Intelligence (to support situated information and planning). Indeed, in most current research, the user's task model is assumed as given and is used as the starting point for generating UIs on the fly. In addition, the functional core is considered to be stable rather than compliant with opportunistic discovery of services. In the coming years, we will need to confront challenges that go beyond HCI: (1) incompleteness and uncertainty of the system perception of both the context of use and of the appropriateness of the adapted UI; (2) combinatory explosion when composing a UI for sustaining emergent users goals. Finally, we will need to develop environments (or studios) for UI Plasticity to integrate partial advances, to make the theory operational and to alleviate designers and developers task.},
