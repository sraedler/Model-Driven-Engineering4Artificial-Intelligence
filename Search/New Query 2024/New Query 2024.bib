  abstract = {As big data grows ubiquitous across many domains, more and more stakeholders seek to develop Machine Learning (ML) applications on their data. The success of an ML application usually depends on the close collaboration of ML experts and domain experts. However, the shortage of ML engineers remains a fundamental problem. Low-code Machine learning tools/platforms (aka, AutoML) aim to democratize ML development to domain experts by automating many repetitive tasks in the ML pipeline. This research presents an empirical study of around 14k posts (questions + accepted answers) from Stack Overflow (SO) that contained AutoML-related discussions. We examine how these topics are spread across the various Machine Learning Life Cycle (MLLC) phases and their popularity and difficulty. This study offers several interesting findings. First, we find 13 AutoML topics that we group into four categories. The MLOps topic category (43\% questions) is the largest, followed by Model (28\% questions), Data (27\% questions), Documentation (2\% questions). Second, Most questions are asked during Model training (29\%) (i.e., implementation phase) and Data preparation (25\%) MLLC phase. Third, AutoML practitioners find the MLOps topic category most challenging, especially topics related to model deployment \& monitoring and Automated ML pipeline. These findings have implications for all three AutoML stakeholders: AutoML researchers, AutoML service vendors, and AutoML developers. Academia and Industry collaboration can improve different aspects of AutoML, such as better DevOps/deployment support and tutorial-based documentation.},

They are also increasingly being applied to facilitate software engineering activities. Following this trend, we are witnessing a growing research interest on recommendation approaches that assist with modelling tasks and model-based development processes. In this paper, we report on a systematic mapping review (based on the analysis of 66 papers) that classifies the existing research work on recommender systems for model-driven engineering (MDE). This study aims to serve as a guide for tool builders and researchers in understanding the MDE tasks that might be subject to recommendations, the applicable recommendation techniques and evaluation methods, and the open challenges and opportunities in this field of research.},

  abstract = {Drones are gaining attention due to its possibility to support wide different types of applications. Since they can operate in different environments, it is possible to encounter uncertainties and exceptional situations, not initially predicted, during the use of drone-based applications. In this realm, self-adaptive strategies have been successfully used to guarantee resilience and continuous execution of such applications despite environment changes. Although some modelling approaches emerged to represent drone concepts, they are limited to model only expected flight plans or include few environmental conditions and drone resources, which restrict considerably their use. To mitigate those problems, this work proposes a domain-specific language, called DRESS-ML, which allows modelling exceptional situations and self-adaptive behaviours for drone-based applications. It relies on the Given-When-Then template used in the Behaviour-driven development (BDD) technique and the some of the main Aspect-oriented Programming concepts. We validate the applicability of our language through a proof of concept regarding an example application that uses a drone to monitor a forest to search for fire spots.Drones are gaining attention due to their possibility of supporting diverse applications and environments, such as search-and-rescue, surveillance, and goods delivery. Due to this variety of applications, drones can face both uncertainties and exceptional situations that they did not initially foresee during flight plan. In this sense, providing the ability to monitor the system and its environment and to change the system to ensure resilience and continuous execution are benefits of self-adaptation strategies. Although some studies have proposed approaches to model drone concepts, they are limited to model only expected flight plans or include few environmental conditions and drone resources, which restrict considerably their use. This work proposes a domain-specific language, called DRESS-ML, which allows modelling exceptional scenarios and self-adaptive behaviors to mitigate those problems. The language is based on an well known structure used for specifying system behaviour and the main concepts of a programming paradigm that injects encapsulated behaviours in the system. A practical example that uses a drone to monitor a forest to search for fire spots is used to evaluate the proposed language, demonstrating its applicability to model various exceptional scenarios.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is a discipline which has become ubiquitous in the last few years. While the research of machine learning algorithms is very active and continues to reveal astonishing possibilities on a regular basis, the wide usage of these algorithms is shifting the research focus to the integration, maintenance, and evolution of AI-driven systems. Although there is a variety of machine learning frameworks on the market, there is little support for process automation and DevOps in machine learning-driven projects. In this paper, we discuss how metamodels can support the development of deep learning frameworks and help deal with the steadily increasing variety of learning algorithms. In particular, we present a deep learning-oriented artifact model which serves as a foundation for build automation and data management in iterative, machine learning-driven development processes. Furthermore, we show how schema and reference models can be used to structure and maintain a versatile deep learning framework. Feasibility is demonstrated on several state-of-the-art examples from the domains of image and natural language processing as well as decision making and autonomous driving.},

  abstract = {Managing dynamic datasets intended to serve as training data for a Machine Learning (ML) model often emerges as very challenging, especially when data is often altered iteratively and already existing ML models should pertain to the data. For example, this applies when new data versions arise from either a generated or aggregated extension of an existing dataset a model has already been trained on. In this work, it is investigated on how a model-based approach for these training data concerns can be provided as well as how the complete process, including the resulting training and retraining process of the ML model, can therein be integrated. Hence, model-based concepts and the implementation are devised to cope with the complexity of iterative data management as an enabler for the integration of continuous retraining routines. With Deep Learning techniques becoming technically feasible and massively being developed further over the last decade, MLOps, aiming to establish DevOps tailored to ML projects, gained crucial relevance. Unfortunately, data-management concepts for iteratively growing datasets with retraining capabilities embedded in a model-driven ML development methodology are unexplored to the best of our knowledge. To fill in this gap, this contribution provides such agile data management concepts and integrates them and continuous retraining into the model-driven ML Framework MontiAnna [18]. The new functionality is evaluated in the context of a research project where ML is exploited for the optimal design of lattice structures for crash applications.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing interest in research on the combination of AI techniques and methods with MDE. However, there is a gap between AI and MDE practices, as well as between researchers and practitioners. This paper tackles this gap by reporting on industrial requirements in this field. In the AIDOaRt research project, practitioners and researchers collaborate on AI-augmented automation supporting modeling, coding, testing, monitoring, and continuous development in cyber-physical systems. The project specifically lies at the intersection of industry and academia collaboration with several industrial use cases. Through a process of elicitation and refinement, 78 high-level requirements were defined, and generalized into 30 generic requirements by the AIDOaRt partners. The main contribution of this paper is the set of generic requirements from the project for enhancing the development of cyber-physical systems with artificial intelligence, DevOps, and model-driven engineering, identifying the hot spots of industry needs in the interactions of MDE and AI. Future work will refine, implement and evaluate solutions toward these requirements in industry contexts.},

The events brought together experts from industry, academia, and the open-source community to assess what has changed in research in MDE over the last 10~years, what challenges remain, and what new challenges have arisen. This article reports on the results of those meetings, and presents a set of               grand challenges               that emerged from discussions and synthesis. These challenges could lead to research initiatives for the community going forward.},

There are at least two ways in which such integrations---which we call MDE Intelligence---can manifest: (1) MDE can benefit from integrating AI concepts and ideas to increasing the power and flexibility of model-driven techniques by means of the application of AI algorithms. (2) Conversely, AI can benefit from integrating concepts and ideas from MDE---for example, using domain-specific languages and model transformations allows domain experts to directly express and manipulate their problems while providing an auditable computation pipeline.To discuss and further stimulate such integrations, the 1st edition of the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Model-driven Engineering (MDE Intelligence) was held on September 16, 2019 in Munich, Germany, as part of the satellite events of the IEEE/ACM 22th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2019).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mobile robots operate in various environments (e.g. aquatic, aerial, or terrestrial), they come in many diverse shapes and they are increasingly becoming parts of our lives. The successful engineering of mobile robotics systems demands the interdisciplinary collaboration of experts from different domains, such as mechanical and electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, and systems engineering. Research and industry have tried to tackle this heterogeneity by proposing a multitude of model-driven solutions to engineer the software of mobile robotics systems. However, there is no systematic study of the state of the art in model-driven engineering (MDE) for mobile robotics systems that could guide research or practitioners in finding model-driven solutions and tools to efficiently engineer mobile robotics systems. The paper is contributing to this direction by providing a map of software engineering research in MDE that investigates (1) which types of robots are supported by existing MDE approaches, (2) the types and characteristics of MRSs that are engineered using MDE approaches, (3) a description of how MDE approaches support the engineering of MRSs, (4) how existing MDE approaches are validated, and (5) how tools support existing MDE approaches. We also provide a replication package to assess, extend, and/or replicate the study. The results of this work and the highlighted challenges can guide researchers and practitioners from robotics and software engineering through the research landscape.},

The Accord Project provides an open-source SLC framework containing three main modules: Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo. Currently, we need lawyers, programmers, and clients to work together with great effort to create a usable SLC using the Accord Project. This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project's Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text. We also delve into some limitations and possible future research for the proposed pipeline. Finally, we describe a web interface enabling users to build SLCs. This interface leverages the proposed pipeline to convert text documents to Smart Legal Contracts by using NLP models.},

People can now use natural language (i.e. prompts) to communicate with AI to perform tasks. While people can use foundation models through chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT), chat, regardless of the capabilities of the underlying models, is not a production tool for building reusable AI services. APIs like LangChain allow for LLM-based application development but require substantial programming knowledge, thus posing a barrier. To mitigate this, we systematically review, summarise, refine and extend the concept of AI chain by incorporating the best principles and practices that have been accumulated in software engineering for decades into AI chain engineering, to systematize AI chain engineering methodology. We also develop a no-code integrated development environment, Prompt Sapper , which embodies these AI chain engineering principles and patterns naturally in the process of building AI chains, thereby improving the performance and quality of AI chains. With Prompt Sapper, AI chain engineers can compose prompt-based AI services on top of foundation models through chat-based requirement analysis and visual programming. Our user study evaluated and demonstrated the efficiency and correctness of Prompt Sapper.},

In this paper we present a Model Driven Development (MDD) approach to develop software systems for HA and AmI. A Domain Specific Language has been designed to model the architecture of these kinds of systems. Then, taking as input the architecture models, a set of model transformations allows code and configuration generation for a specific device platform like KNX/EIB (European Installation Bus).},

  abstract = {Researchers have explored several avenues to mitigate data scientists' frustrations with computational notebooks, including: (1) live programming, to keep notebook results consistent and up to date; (2) supplementing scripting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), to improve ease of use; and (3) providing domain-specific languages (DSLs), to raise a script's level of abstraction. This paper introduces Glinda, which combines these three approaches by providing a live programming experience, with interactive results, for a domain-specific language for data science. The language's compiler uses an open-ended set of ``recipes'' to execute steps in the user's data science workflow. Each recipe is intended to combine the expressiveness of a written notation with the ease-of-use of a GUI. Live programming provides immediate feedback to a user's input, whether in the form of program edits or GUI gestures. In a qualitative evaluation with 12 professional data scientists, participants highly rated the live programming and interactive results. They found the language productive and sufficiently expressive and suggested opportunities to extend it.},

  abstract = {The market of cloud computing encompasses an ever-growing number of cloud providers offering a multitude of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions. The heterogeneity of these solutions hinders the proper exploitation of cloud computing since it prevents interoperability and promotes vendor lock-in, which increases the complexity of executing and managing multi-cloud applications (i.e., Applications that can be deployed across multiple cloud infrastructures and platforms). Providers of multi-cloud applications seek to exploit the peculiarities of each cloud solution and to combine the delivery models of IaaS and PaaS in order to optimise performance, availability, and cost. In this paper, we show how the Cloud Modelling Framework leverages upon model-driven engineering to tame this complexity by providing: (i) a tool-supported domain-specific language for specifying the provisioning and deployment of multi-cloud applications, and (ii) a models@run-time environment for enacting the provisioning, deployment, and adaptation of these applications.},

  abstract = {The application of the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) approach implies the use of new styles of computer-human interaction as well as the need of supporting activities of collaborative nature. In these contexts, the concept of implicit interaction refers to those actions that a computer considers as inputs although the user has not intended to generate an input in an explicit way. In order to provide AmI scenarios in which collaborative activities takes place with computational support, classic concepts about computer-human interaction are not enough, for example, when giving support to awareness. Thus, in this paper a framework for the design of awareness support in collaborative AmI applications is proposed. This framework takes the work by Gutwin and Greenberg on explicit interaction as a starting point and intends to serve as a design guide for developers who need to create such a system. Also, this work settles the basis for a future model-based development method for collaborative AmI systems that takes into account awareness issues.},

  abstract = {The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one's experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The environments are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed for ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current progress of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously search for and select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative information. Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic framework that consists of aspects important to planning for ubiquitous computing. The framework's main purpose is to facilitate the understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify future challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing.},

Existing engineering processes and tools facilitate the development of various robotic aspects including kinematics, sensing and, architecture, through high-level design and low-level code generation. Although there are several frameworks and middleware, providing infrastructure for the development of single-robot and homogeneous multi-robot applications, there is lack of systematic methods and tools supporting the engineering of heterogeneous multi-robot systems and the analysis of collaborative intelligence. In this paper, we present our vision for a framework that supports the specification of collaborative heterogeneous robotic systems, generation of platform-specific code, and efficient exploration and exercise of collective intelligence algorithms.},

Changes in the domain models exist due to system evolution and the emergence of new requirements. In these applications, domain models evolve using CRUD operations requested by users. However, it is necessary to support changes in domain models during the applications' runtime when new (unforeseen) situations may occur. This work presents an architecture called DoME, which relies on natural language processing (NLP) to allow users to trigger changes in the domain models and self-adaptation techniques to update the models at runtime. It is instantiated in a concrete architecture using a chatbot in Telegram and Transformers Libraries for NLP. The architecture has been preliminary evaluated regarding its assertiveness and user satisfaction, resulting in an 82.55\% hit rate and confirming that NL provides good usability and facilitates data manipulation.},

MDE could enable domain experts to leverage the expressiveness of models, while implementation details on different hardware platforms would be handled by automatic code generation. Today, despite strong MDE efforts in the robotics research community, most evidence points to manual code development being the norm. A possible reason for MDE not being accepted by robot software developers could be the wide range of applications and target platforms, which make all-encompassing MDE IDEs hard to develop and maintain. Therefore, we chose to leverage a large corpus of open-source software widely adopted by the robotics community to extract common structures and gain insight on how and where MDE can support the developers to work more efficiently. We pursue modeling as a complement, rather than imposing MDE as separate solution. Our previous work introduced metamodels to describe components, their interactions, and their resulting composition. In this paper, we present two methods based on metamodels for automated generation of models from manually written artifacts: (1) through static code analysis and (2) by monitoring the execution of a running system. For both methods, we present tools that leverage the potentials of our contributions, with a special focus on their application at runtime to observe and diagnose a real system during its execution. A comprehensive example is provided as a walk-through for robotics software practitioners.},

  abstract = {We present a no-code Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform called Trinity with the main design goal of enabling both machine learning researchers and non-technical geospatial domain experts to experiment with domain-specific signals and datasets for solving a variety of complex problems on their own. This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its design along with showcasing sample applications to motivate the idea of lowering the bar to using AI.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Model composition is a crucial activity in Model Driven Engineering both to reuse validated and verified model elements and to handle separately the various aspects in a complex system and then weave them while preserving their properties. Many research activities target this compositional validation and verification (V \& V) strategy: allow the independent assessment of components and minimize the residual V \& V activities at assembly time. However, there is a continuous and increasing need for the definition of new composition operators that allow the reconciliation of existing models to build new systems according to various requirements. These ones are usually built from scratch and must be systematically verified to assess that they preserve the properties of the assembled elements. This verification is usually tedious but is mandatory to avoid verifying the composite system for each use of the operators. Our work addresses these issues, we first target the use of proof assistants for specifying and verifying compositional verification frameworks relying on formal verification techniques instead of testing and proofreading. Then, using a divide and conquer approach, we focus on the development of elementary composition operators that are easy to verify and can be used to further define complex composition operators. In our approach, proofs for the complex operators are then obtained by assembling the proofs of the basic operators. To illustrate our proposal, we use the Coq proof assistant to formalize the language-independent elementary composition operators Union and Substitution and the proof that the conformance of models with respect to metamodels is preserved during composition. We show that more sophisticated composition operators that share parts of the implementation and have several properties in common (especially: aspect oriented modeling composition approach, invasive software composition, and package merge) can then be built from the basic ones, and that the proof of conformance preservation can also be built from the proofs of basic operators.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose to adopt the MDE paradigm for the development of Machine Learning (ML)-enabled software systems with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. We illustrate how two state-of-the-art open-source modeling tools, namely MontiAnna and ML-Quadrat can be used for this purpose as demonstrated through a case study. The case study illustrates using ML, in particular deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for automated image recognition of handwritten digits using the MNIST reference dataset, and integrating the machine learning components into an IoT-system. Subsequently, we conduct a functional comparison of the two frameworks, setting out an analysis base to include a broad range of design considerations, such as the problem domain, methods for the ML integration into larger systems, and supported ML methods, as well as topics of recent intense interest to the ML community, such as AutoML and MLOps. Accordingly, this paper is focused on elucidating the potential of the MDE approach in the ML domain. This supports the ML-engineer in developing the (ML/software) model rather than implementing the code, and additionally enforces reusability and modularity of the design through enabling the out-of-the-box integration of ML functionality as a component of the IoT or cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract = {More and more tasks become solvable using deep learning technology nowadays. Consequently, the amount of neural network code in software rises continuously. To make the new paradigm more accessible, frameworks, languages, and tools keep emerging. Although, the maturity of these tools is steadily increasing, we still lack appropriate domain specific languages and a high degree of automation when it comes to deep learning for productive systems. In this paper we present a multi-paradigm language family allowing the AI engineer to model and train deep neural networks as well as to integrate them into software architectures containing classical code. Using input and output layers as strictly typed interfaces enables a seamless embedding of neural networks into component-based models. The lifecycle of deep learning components can then be governed by a compiler accordingly, e.g. detecting when (re-)training is necessary or when network weights can be shared between different network instances. We provide a compelling case study, where we train an autonomous vehicle for the TORCS simulator. Furthermore, we discuss how the methodology automates the AI development process if neural networks are changed or added to the system.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to trace the knowledge of students as they solve a sequence of problems represented by their related skills. This involves abstract concepts of students' states of knowledge and the interactions between those states and skills. Therefore, a KT model is designed to predict whether students will give correct answers and to describe such abstract concepts. However, existing methods either give relatively low prediction accuracy or fail to explain those concepts intuitively. In this paper, we propose a new model called Knowledge Query Network (KQN) to solve these problems. KQN uses neural networks to encode student learning activities into knowledge state and skill vectors, and models the interactions between the two types of vectors with the dot product. Through this, we introduce a novel concept called probabilistic skill similarity that relates the pairwise cosine and Euclidean distances between skill vectors to the odds ratios of the corresponding skills, which makes KQN interpretable and intuitive.On four public datasets, we have carried out experiments to show the following: 1. KQN outperforms all the existing KT models based on prediction accuracy. 2. The interaction between the knowledge state and skills can be visualized for interpretation. 3. Based on probabilistic skill similarity, a skill domain can be analyzed with clustering using the distances between the skill vectors of KQN. 4. For different values of the vector space dimensionality, KQN consistently exhibits high prediction accuracy and a strong positive correlation between the distance matrices of the skill vectors.},

This paper reports the results of a comparative study of different ML classification techniques employed to automatically label models stored in model repositories. We have built a framework to systematically compare different ML models (feed-forward neural networks, graph neural networks, k-nearest neighbors, support version machines, etc.) with varying model encodings (TF-IDF, word embeddings, graphs and paths). We apply this framework to two datasets of about 5,000 Ecore and 5,000 UML models. We show that specific ML models and encodings perform better than others depending on the characteristics of the available datasets (e.g., the presence of duplicates) and on the goals to be achieved.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to address problems related to model-driven engineering (MDE) is currently hindered by the lack of curated datasets of software models. There are several reasons for this, including the lack of large collections of good quality models, the difficulty to label models due to the required domain expertise, and the relative immaturity of the application of ML to MDE. In this work, we present               ModelSet               , a labelled dataset of software models intended to enable the application of ML to address software modelling problems. To create it we have devised a method designed to facilitate the exploration and labelling of model datasets by interactively grouping similar models using off-the-shelf technologies like a search engine. We have built an Eclipse plug-in to support the labelling process, which we have used to label 5,466~Ecore meta-models and 5,120~UML models with its category as the main label plus additional secondary labels of interest. We have evaluated the ability of our labelling method to create meaningful groups of models in order to speed up the process, improving the effectiveness of classical clustering methods. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset by applying it in a real scenario: enhancing the MAR search engine. We use               ModelSet               to train models able to infer useful metadata to navigate search results. The dataset and the tooling are available at               https://figshare.com/s/5a6c02fa8ed20782935c               and a live version at               http://modelset.github.io               .},

In this demo paper, we will present ModelSet, a dataset composed of 5,466 Ecore models and 5,120 UML models which have been manually labelled to support ML tasks (http://modelset.github.io). ModelSet is built upon the models collected by the MAR search engine (http://mar-search.org), which provides more than 500,000 models of different types. We will describe the structure of the dataset and we will explain how to use the associated library to develop ML applications in Python. Finally, we will describe some applications which can be addressed using ModelSet.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Models are used in both Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). SE models may specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction and for addressing different concerns at various stages of the software development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design, to verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may provide smart capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For instance, in Machine Learning (ML), which is currently the most popular sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful patterns in the observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this work is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic approach to model-driven software development for intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate how software models can become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner. The main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and model-driven SE play a key role. In the context of the need to take a Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of the targeted architecture, an integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would best support the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting system. In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat, based on ThingML, and validate it using a case study from the IoT domain, as well as through an empirical user evaluation. It transpires that the proposed approach is not only feasible, but may also contribute to the performance leap of software development for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are connected to the IoT, as well as an enhanced user experience of the practitioners who use the proposed modeling solution.},

  abstract = {Recently, several studies have proposed frameworks for Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). For instance, the Google TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) and TensorFlow Federated (TFF) libraries have been deployed for realizing QFL. However, developers, in the main, are not as yet familiar with Quantum Computing (QC) libraries and frameworks. A Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) that provides an abstraction layer over the underlying QC and Federated Learning (FL) libraries would be beneficial. This could enable practitioners to carry out software development and data science tasks efficiently while deploying the state of the art in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this position paper, we propose extending existing domain-specific Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools for Machine Learning (ML) enabled systems, such as MontiAnna, ML-Quadrat, and GreyCat, to support QFL.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Emergent paradigms of Industry~4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, a               reflective               architecture developed around               digital twins               enables representation and control of system               Configuration Items               properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones.},

This paper also shows how we integrated proactive modeling into the Generic Modeling Environment (GME). Our experience using proactive modeling shows that it can reduce modeling effort by both automatically generating required model elements, and guiding modelers to select what actions should be executed on the model.},

Machine Learning algorithms are one area that has been used in Big Data for analysis. However, because of the challenges Big Data imposes, these algorithms need to be adapted and optimized to specific applications. One important decision made by software engineers is the choice of the language that is used in the implementation of these algorithms. This literature survey identifies and describes domain-specific languages and frameworks used for Machine Learning in Big Data with the intention of assisting software engineers in making more informed choices and providing beginners with an overview of the main languages used in this domain. This is the first survey that aims at better understanding how domain-specific languages for Machine Learning are used as a tool for research in Big Data.},

  abstract = {Data-driven engineering refers to systematic data collection and processing using machine learning to improve engineering systems. Currently, the implementation of data-driven engineering relies on fundamental data science and software engineering skills. At the same time, model-based engineering is gaining relevance for the engineering of complex systems. In previous work, a model-based engineering approach integrating the formalization of machine learning tasks using the general-purpose modeling language SysML is presented. However, formalized machine learning tasks still require the implementation in a specialized programming languages like Python. Therefore, this work aims to facilitate the implementation of data-driven engineering in practice by extending the previous work of formalizing machine learning tasks by integrating model transformation to generate executable code. The method focuses on the modifiability and maintainability of the model transformation so that extensions and changes to the code generation can be integrated without requiring modifications to the code generator. The presented method is evaluated for feasibility in a case study to predict weather forecasts. Based thereon, quality attributes of model transformations are assessed and discussed. Results demonstrate the flexibility and the simplicity of the method reducing efforts for implementation. Further, the work builds a theoretical basis for standardizing data-driven engineering implementation in practice.},

  abstract = {Due to the long runtime of Data Science (DS) pipelines, even small programming mistakes can be very costly, if they are not detected statically. However, even basic static type checking of DS pipelines is difficult because most are written in Python. Static typing is available in Python only via external linters. These require static type annotations for parameters or results of functions, which many DS libraries do not provide.In this paper, we show how the wealth of Python DS libraries can be used in a statically safe way via Safe-DS, a domain specific language (DSL) for DS. Safe-DS catches conventional type errors plus errors related to range restrictions, data manipulation, and call order of functions, going well beyond the abilities of current Python linters. Python libraries are integrated into Safe-DS via a stub language for specifying the interface of its declarations, and an API-Editor that is able to extract type information from the code and documentation of Python libraries, and automatically generate suitable stubs.Moreover, Safe-DS complements textual DS pipelines with a graphical representation that eases safe development by preventing syntax errors. The seamless synchronization of textual and graphic view lets developers always choose the one best suited for their skills and current task.We think that Safe-DS can make DS development easier, faster, and more reliable, significantly reducing development costs.},

Their inner workings relying on models learning with data are as helpful as they are mysterious for non-expert people. There is an increasing need to make the design and development of those solutions accessible to a more general public while at the same time making them easier to explore. In this paper, to address this need, we discuss a proposition of a new assisted approach, centered on the downstream task to be performed, for helping practitioners to start using and applying Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This proposal, supported by an initial testbed UI prototype, uses an externalized form of knowledge, where JSON files compile different pipeline metadata information with their respective related artifacts (e.g., model code, the dataset to be loaded, good hyperparameter choices) that are presented as the user interacts with a conversational agent to suggest candidate solutions for a given task.},

  abstract = {Modern vehicles are extremely complex embedded systems that integrate software and hardware from a large set of contributors. Modeling standards like EAST-ADL have shown promising results to reduce complexity and expedite system development. However, such standards are unable to cope with the growing demands of the automotive industry. A typical example of this phenomenon is autonomous vehicle perception (AVP) where deep learning architectures (DLA) are required for computer vision (CV) tasks like real-time object recognition and detection. However, existing modeling standards in the automotive industry are unable to manage such CV tasks at a higher abstraction level. Consequently, system development is currently accomplished through modeling approaches like EAST-ADL while DLA-based CV features for AVP are implemented in isolation at a lower abstraction level. This significantly compromises productivity due to integration challenges. In this article, we introduce MoDLF - A Model-Driven Deep learning Framework to design deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures for AVP tasks. Particularly, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is leveraged to propose a metamodel along with a conformant graphical modeling workbench to model DCNNs for CV tasks in AVP at a higher abstraction level. Furthermore, Model-To-Text (M2T) transformations are provided to generate executable code for MATLAB{\textregistered} and Python. The framework is validated via two case studies on benchmark datasets for key AVP tasks. The results prove that MoDLF effectively enables model-driven architectural exploration of deep convnets for AVP system development while supporting integration with renowned existing standards like EAST-ADL.},

  abstract = {Traditional software engineering programming paradigms are mostly object or procedure oriented, driven by deterministic algorithms. With the advent of deep learning and cognitive sciences there is an emerging trend for data-driven programming, creating a shift in the programming paradigm among the software engineering communities. Visualizing and interpreting the execution of a current large scale data-driven software development is challenging. Further, for deep learning development there are many libraries in multiple programming languages such as TensorFlow (Python), CAFFE (C++), Theano (Python), Torch (Lua), and Deeplearning4j (Java), driving a huge need for interoperability across libraries.We propose a model driven development based solution frame-work, that facilitates intuitive designing of deep learning models in a platform agnostic fashion. This framework could potentially generate library specific code, perform program translation across languages, and debug the training process of a deep learning model from a fault localization and repair perspective. Further we identify open research problems in this emerging domain, and discuss some new software tooling requirements to serve this new age data-driven programming paradigm.},

  abstract = {Model Based Software Engineering (MBSE) consists in applying Model-Based Engineering principles - mostly abstraction and automation - to software engineering practices. As concluded by several empirical studies during the past 10 years, applying MBSE methodology is no more a question and we shall now wonder how to do it rather than if we should. One of the major criticisms of MBSE remains about the available tooling to apply its methodology. Multiple surveys show that the usability of tools and the lack of skills from the user are two key barriers that still slow down the spread of the MBSE approach. In the meantime, these surveys also highlight the difficulties software engineers often encounter during the modeling activity itself, regardless of the tool. Indeed, complex operations such as problem-to-model mapping, consistency checking or error identification are still often manually performed by humans. The recent advances in AIs introduced new software-based systems able to interact with their users to help them in their daily life. The purpose of this PhD is to investigate how such AIs (which we will call software assistants) could help software engineers to face the complexity of software modeling. Interactions between software assistants and users of MBSE tools will be the bulk of this work. We plan to implement software assistants and provide them an access to a high-quality knowledge repository on models that we will build to study these interactions. Based on these studies, we hope to contribute laying the foundations of interactions with software assistants. The end result will feature a knowledge repository and a Software Assistant acting together to help users modeling by catering for new ideas, recommendations and help. This work will also provide frameworks to create knowledge repositories and IDE-embedded software assistants.},

  abstract = {We present our new ideas on taking the first steps towards cultivating synergy between model-driven engineering (MDE), machine learning, and software clones. Specifically, we describe our vision in realizing a cognizant virtual software modeling assistant that uses the latter two to improve software design and MDE. Software engineering has benefited greatly from knowledge-based cognizant source code completion and assistance, but MDE has few and limited analogous capabilities. We outline our research directions by describing our vision for a prototype assistant that provides suggestions to modelers performing model creation or extension in the form of 1) complete models for insertion or guidance, and 2) granular single-step operations. These suggestions are derived by detecting clones of the in-progress model and existing domain, organizational, and exemplar models. We overview our envisioned workflow between modeler and assistant, and, using Simulink as an example, illustrate different manifestations including multiple overlays with percentages and employing variant elements.},

The computationally expensive nature of these networks has led to the proliferation of implementations that sacrifice abstraction for high performance. In this paper, we present Latte, a domain-specific language for DNNs that provides a natural abstraction for specifying new layers without sacrificing performance. Users of Latte express DNNs as ensembles of neurons with connections between them. The Latte compiler synthesizes a program based on the user specification, applies a suite of domain-specific and general optimizations, and emits efficient machine code for heterogeneous architectures. Latte also includes a communication runtime for distributed memory data-parallelism. Using networks described using Latte, we demonstrate 3-6x speedup over Caffe (C++/MKL) on the three state-of-the-art ImageNet models executing on an Intel Xeon E5-2699 v3 x86 CPU.},

This complexity of AI products hinders seamless execution and interdisciplinary collaboration crucial for human-centered AI products. Relevant to industry and innovation, it affects strategic decision-making and investment risk mitigation. Current approaches provide limited insights into the potential and feasibility of AI product ideas. Employing Design Science Research, the study identifies challenges and integrates no-code AutoML as a solution by presenting a framework for AI product prototyping with No-code AutoML. A case study confirms its potential in supporting non-experts, offering a structured approach to AI product development. The framework facilitates accessible and interpretable prototyping, benefiting academia, managers, and decision-makers. Strategic integration of no-code AutoML enhances efficiency, empowers non-experts, and informs early-stage decisions, albeit with acknowledged limitations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Engineering cyber-physical systems inhabiting contemporary urban spatial environments demands software engineering facilities to support design and operation. Tools and approaches in civil engineering and architectural informatics produce artifacts that are geometrical or geographical representations describing physical spaces. The models we consider conform to the CityGML standard; although relying on international standards and accessible in machine-readable formats, such physical space descriptions often lack semantic information that can be used to support analyses. In our context, analysis as commonly understood in software engineering refers to reasoning on properties of an abstracted model---in this case a city design. We support model-based development, firstly by providing a way to derive analyzable models from CityGML descriptions, and secondly, we ensure that changes performed are propagated correctly. Essentially, a digital twin of a city is kept synchronized, in both directions, with the information from the actual city. Specifically, our formal programming technique and accompanying technical framework assure that relevant information added, or changes applied to the domain (resp. analyzable) model are reflected back in the analyzable (resp. domain) model automatically and coherently. The technique developed is rooted in the theory of bidirectional transformations, which guarantees that synchronization between models is consistent and well behaved. Produced models can bootstrap graph-theoretic, spatial or dynamic analyses. We demonstrate that bidirectional transformations can be achieved in practice on real city models.},

A recent work investigated, using reactive synthesis, approaches to automate robot task planning, and execution. In this paper, we present a tool that realizes a model-at-runtime approach. The tool is integrated with a robot simulation tool, to automate efficient multi-robot choreography planning, and execution. We illustrate the tool using a multi-robot spot welding cell, inspired from an industrial case. Given a virtual model of the production cell, and user constraints definition, the tool can derive a specification for the reactive synthesis. The tool integrates the synthesized controller with the production cell execution, and in real time, optimizes the strategies by considering the uncertainties. The system can select among several correct, and safe actions, the optimal action using AI-based planning techniques, such as the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We showcase our tool, illustrate its implementation architecture, including how it can support robot experts for automated planning and execution of production cells.},

Code generation is one of the main elements of Model-Driven Engineering, involving transformation from specification models to produce executable code. A code generator is designed to reduce the manual program construction work used to implement a software system, but building a code generator itself still currently needs much manual effort. Meanwhile, existing code generators are typically not flexible to adjust for changing development requirements and are hard to reuse for different target languages.Therefore, we aim to provide techniques to improve the process of building code generators, and let them be more reusable.Currently, we researched the related new and traditional approaches for generating code and projects using AI for program translation, code completion or program generation. Based on this research we decided to focus on a symbolic machine learning method related to the programming-by-example concept to build code generators. We use this "Code Generation By Example" (CGBE) concept with tree-to-tree structure mappings as the information format. CGBE has good performance in terms of training dataset size and time when applied to learning a UML-to-Java code generator, but further work is needed to extend it to generate different programming languages and to evaluate these cases, and to handle the optimisation of generated code.},

Our approach is a pipeline of steps consisting of the segmentation of the input into sentences, the classification of the sentences, the generation of UML class diagram fragments from sentences, and the composition of these fragments into one UML class diagram. We develop a quantitative testing framework specific to UML class diagram extraction. Our approach yields low precision and recall but serves as a benchmark for future research.},

  abstract = {Models produced by machine learning are not guaranteed to be free from bias, particularly when trained and tested with data produced in discriminatory environments. The bias can be unethical, mainly when the data contains sensitive attributes, such as sex, race, age, etc. Some approaches have contributed to mitigating such biases by providing bias metrics and mitigation algorithms. The challenge is users have to implement their code in general/statistical programming languages, which can be demanding for users with little programming and fairness in machine learning experience. We present FairML, a model-based approach to facilitate bias measurement and mitigation with reduced software development effort. Our evaluation shows that FairML requires fewer lines of code to produce comparable measurement values to the ones produced by the baseline code.},

  abstract = {Most dataflow accelerator compilers achieve high performance by mapping each node in a dataflow program to a dedicated hardware element on a dataflow accelerator. However, this approach misses critical data reuse optimizations required to exploit the data bandwidth from fine-grained memory elements, e.g., FIFOs and pipeline registers. Moreover, writing performant dataflow programs requires users to have domain expertise in the underlying dataflow accelerators. To address these issues, we designed Sigma, a novel compiler that supports high-level programming constructs such as Einstein summations, index notations, and tensors, finds opportunities for data reuse from high-level dataflow graphs, and exploits on-chip data bandwidth from fine-grained memory elements. Sigma targeting a research dataflow accelerator demonstrates a 5.4x speedup and 44.6x area-normalized speedup over Nvidia's V100 accelerator, and a 7.1x speedup over hand-written dataflow programs.},
